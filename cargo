#!/bin/bash

# This is a drop-in replacement for `cargo`
# that runs in a Docker container as the current user
# on the latest Rust image
# and saves all generated files to `./cargo/` and `./target/`.
#
# Be sure to make this file executable: `chmod +x ./cargo`
#
# # Examples
#
# - Running app: `./cargo run`
# - Building app: `./cargo build`
# - Building release: `./cargo build --release`
#
# # Installing globally
#
# To run `cargo` from anywhere,
# save this file to `/usr/local/bin`.
# You'll then be able to use `cargo`
# as if you had installed Rust globally.
